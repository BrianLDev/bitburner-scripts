/*
ARRAY JUMPING GAME
You are given the following array of integers:

5,9,0,0,8,10

Each element in the array represents your MAXIMUM jump length at that position. This means that if you are at position i and your maximum jump length is n, you can jump to any position from i to i+n.

Assuming you are initially positioned at the start of the array, determine whether you are able to reach the last index.

Your answer should be submitted as 1 or 0, representing true and false respectively
*/

let arr = [5,9,0,0,8,10]

// this one's obvious. no code needed.  Make one in future for more complex challenges
